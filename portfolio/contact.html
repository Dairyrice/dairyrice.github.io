	     My name is Derek Bui. I'm currently a fourth year at San Jose State University. I started to major in Digital Media Art when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to major in
       for my college life. After graduating high school, I was still wondering what to do in my life. I was debating with myself to either just go to college and find my future that way,
       or just work for the rest of my life. I was even questioning myself if I was truly happy with the decisions that I made to be satisfied in life. But eventually, I decided to major
       in Digital Media Art because not only will I learn many different skills from many mediums, I feel like taking this major would help me in the future. I wanted to learn the ways of
       making art in the digital spectrum. Throughout my time being in the Digital Media Arts program, I learned many different skills such as photoshop, illustrator, video editing, web
       development, and many more. But the digital mediums that I feel the most comfortable with are mainly video and photography. One of the objectives that I want to achieve for my career
       is to make art for a living and make a business out of it. I always wanted to make a business in making art and make a living out of it. But that is not my priority in terms of my goals
       as an artist. The main goal that I wanted to achieve as an artist is to make art pieces that can be inspiring and spread a message. I want to make art pieces that can let people learn
       about the messages Iâ€™m trying to spread within my work. The art that I want to show is more like an act of awareness and spreading the message as much as I can. So in my last few years
       at San Jose State University, I want to achieve my goal by then. If I was able to achieve my goal by then, I can be happy and proud of myself. That is why I wanted to apply for the BFA
       portfolio review because I believe that if I want to achieve my goal of spreading messages through my art, I need to learn what I can do better and help improve myself. I want to take
       as much feedback as I can and make use of that information to help improve my art in the future. If I can have that option before I end my college life, then that would help me achieve
       my goal to do so. Making art has been one of the things that I love to do, and continuing my career would mean that I can have more opportunities to make awareness of the world.
       If I can at least do that then I will do my best to do so. I will do anything that I can to spread awareness through my art and make people feel inspired by it.
